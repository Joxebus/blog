## Hello World from Groovy

[![What is groovy lang](/blog/assets/img/2022/what_is_groovy.png "Basic concepts of Groovy Lang")](/blog/assets/img/2022/what_is_groovy.png)

Once we have successfully installed Groovy we can start executing scripts both in the command prompt
**(Groovy Shell)** and in the **Groovy Console**.

I have worked on a tool to execute scripts, you can test the **Online Groovy Console**
[here.](https://onlinegroovyconsole.herokuapp.com/ "Online Groovy Console")

### Executing a "Hello World Groovy!"

We open the Windows console or the shell of your choice in your OS _(The following examples are given
with Windows)_

### Command: _groovy_

A series of options are listed that can be combined with the `groovy` command, if for example we
want to write a "Hello Groovy World!" in console just write the following

```shell
groovy -e "println "Hello Groovy World!"
```

### Command: _groovysh_ (groovy shell)

The command **_groovysh_** activates the groovy shell in the Windows console, giving us the possibility
to execute more complex scripts from it, whenever we execute a method in Groovy, it returns the last
value we tried and denotes it with 3 signs `=` and a greater than `>` , as you can see in this example
the return value of the `println` method is `null`

### Command: _groovyConsole_ 

The **_groovyConsole_** command opens an instance of the console that Groovy installations by default for
script execution.
